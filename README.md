# Non-universality-in-SK-model

Notes:
j_dist_sims_final.ipynb and j_dist_sims_final copy.ipynb are the same (purpose of the copy is to run more simulations at the same time).

analysis.ipynb - has all the plots used in the paper
deltaE_analysis.ipynb - runs simulations for the histogram of delta E values.

helper.py useful function class for plotting and processing data. 

sparse_lam_data: data from Sparsify
